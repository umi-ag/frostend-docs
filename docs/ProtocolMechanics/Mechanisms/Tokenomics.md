Team tokens vest up to April 2023. Beyond this, any increase to circulating supply will be contributed by incentives and ecosystem building. 

Weekly emission as of Oct-2022 is 667,705 with a 1.1% decrease each week until April 2026. At this point, the current tokenomics allow for a terminal inflation rate of 2% per annum for incentives. 

As the industry matures, governance may propose changes based on the evolution of ecosystem best practices.

# Dashboard (Beta)

The dashboard is designed to help FrostEnd users manage all of your positions. It offers a comprehensive view of your portfolio, allowing you to easily track all of your historical and current performance on FrostEnd itself.

Yield and rewards accrued from any Yield Tokens (YT) and Liquidity Provision (LP) positions can also be directly monitored and claimed here.

## Overview

#### My Total Balance

Total current, *active* positions on the selected chain in dollar terms

#### My Net Seasonal P&L

Total realized P&L on the selected chain in the season (the current Beta season spans from Nov 2022 till now). Do note that the P&L here will be counted in underlying terms. For example:

Buy 1 PT-stETH with 0.9 ETH ($1000), *1 month later….*

Sell 1 PT-stETH for 0.8 ETH ($1200)

The buy-and-sell transactions above will be logged as a *loss* of 0.1 ETH, converted to dollar terms ($150) based on ETH price at the point of sale, despite there being a net profit in dollar terms from ETH price appreciation.

The P&L figure only includes realized positions. Unclaimed yield and rewards *will not* count towards this P&L figure. You will have to claim the unclaimed positions for them to be included in the P&L and the overall leaderboard number.

For more information on how FrostEnd transactions are logged as P&L, you can look at the table below.

#### My Claimable Yield & Rewards

All of the accrued yield and rewards from YT and LP that can be [claimed](https://docs.frostend.com/AppGuide/Trade/Guides/Claim) on the selected chain

#### Leaderboard

Shows your P&L ranking compared to other yield traders on the Seasonal Leaderboard. Note that only rankings ≥1000 will be shown. You can access the Leaderboard by clicking the button [here](https://app.frostend.com/trade/dashboard/leaderboard/valuation).

All of the figures shown are applicable to the selected chain only. You can switch the display by simply connecting to a different network (e.g. switching from Ethereum → Arbitrum) on the app.

## All My Positions

The lower part of the Dashboard breaks down your FrostEnd positions by Assets, including which active positions you hold for that particular asset (i.e. PT, YT or LP), its Total Position Value as well as P&L.

The “Transactions” tab shows all the transactions related to the asset, including realized profit by transactions. Clicking on the actions (e.g. “Claim Yield” or “LP Transferred Out”) under the column will bring you to the transaction page on the blockchain explorer.
